Makefile need locatin of MPF library. Andrey's location is here and you can use it:
/nfs/pdx/home/aayupov/work_systemc/atd_fpga_app-qa_bblocks/cci_mpf/SW
Otherwise, edit Makefile where CCI_MPF_SW_ROOT is set

make prefix=/nfs/site/disks/scl.work.59/ppt/smburns/quick-assist/SR-5.0.3-Release/Base/SW/install
